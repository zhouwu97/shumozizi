# Source basis for `nature-statistics`

This file keeps the skill conservative. It is a local summary of sources the agent should use to justify reporting checks; it is not a replacement for the target journal's current author instructions.

## Primary source hierarchy

1. **Target journal instructions and user-supplied protocol**
   - Use these first when the user provides them.
   - If a reviewer comment or statistical analysis plan gives a stricter requirement, follow that local constraint.

2. **Nature Portfolio reporting standards**
   - Nature Portfolio frames reporting transparency around the ability of readers to replicate and build on published claims.
   - Where relevant, manuscripts sent for review may require completed reporting summary documents.
   - For life sciences, behavioural and social sciences, ecology, evolution and environmental sciences, the reporting summary asks authors to provide details of experimental and analytical design that are often poorly reported.

3. **Nature / Nature Methods statistics guidance**
   - The Nature collection `Statistics for Biologists` groups practical guidance on statistical design, P values, power, sample size, error bars, multiple comparisons, nonparametric tests, experimental design, replication, nested designs, regression, outliers, and correlation versus causation.
   - Treat this collection as practical guidance for common failure modes, not as a single mandatory checklist for every field.

4. **Study-type reporting guidelines**
   - Use these only when the study type clearly applies or the user requests them.
   - Examples: CONSORT for randomized trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for systematic reviews, ARRIVE for animal research, and field-specific community standards.

5. **Conservative statistical reporting practice**
   - If no field-specific rule is available, require enough information for a reader to identify the design, analysis unit, test/model, assumptions, correction strategy, sample size, uncertainty, and software.

## Implementation boundaries

The skill should not pretend that Nature has one universal statistical recipe. It should instead enforce transparent reporting and identify risks that reviewers commonly challenge.

Use careful language:

- Prefer: `The manuscript should define the independent experimental unit.`
- Avoid: `Nature requires this exact test.` unless the journal instruction actually says so.

When the user supplies a target journal or reporting summary, ask for or use that document before relying on generic guidance.

## Key reporting principles used by this skill

- Replication depends on the independent experimental unit, not merely the number of measurements.
- Statistical tests are interpretable only relative to the design, assumptions, and data structure.
- P values should not carry the full evidential burden; effect estimates, uncertainty, design quality, and reproducibility matter.
- Multiple testing changes interpretation and usually needs a declared correction or a clearly justified family of planned comparisons.
- Figures should expose the data structure: `n`, error-bar meaning, test/model, correction, and whether points represent independent units or subsamples.
- Missing statistical details should be surfaced as author questions, not silently repaired.
